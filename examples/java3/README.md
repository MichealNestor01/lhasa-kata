# Example implementation 3
This is a start off setup for building a deep learning neural network based classification.
This will immediately provide a classification based upon the available training data.

However to make a good classification, it requires good mapping of suitable input values, good choice of settings and possible fine tuning.
Note that this will not be a perfect decision workflow, but is a quick way of
Thus this approach is really valuable when modelling a classification where the rules are not as well defined as in our example, or are not known at all. 
## To run the classification
* Requires Java 17
* Run this via the unit test or however you prefer.
* File input and output not yet implemented
